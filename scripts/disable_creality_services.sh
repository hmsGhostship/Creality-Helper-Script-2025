# The K1C 2025 starts its stock daemons from /usr/apps/etc/init.d via /etc/init.d/rcK,
# which iterates over "$(ls -r .../CS??*)". That glob still matches a ".disabled"
# SUFFIX, so the suffix rename used for the /usr/bin binaries in
# creality_web_interface.sh would be a silent no-op here - the daemon would simply
# start again at the next boot. Every rename below therefore uses the "disabled."
# PREFIX, matching what moonraker_nginx.sh already does for S56moonraker_service and
# what tools_menu_K1C_2025.sh checks for the Klipper configuration lock.
#
# Services this option must never disable, whatever a later edit is tempted to add:
#   klipper_service - Klipper itself.
#   nexusp_service  - the touchscreen backend on :7125. Retiring it is possible,
#                     but it needs a compatibility shim for two JSON-RPC methods
#                     the screen calls and a print-history merge, so it belongs
#                     to Retire Nexusp Backend (retire_nexusp.sh) and not here.
#   quintusp        - HAL for the LCD backlight, chassis LED, camera arbitration
#                     and the power-loss GPIO. Disabling it breaks power-loss
#                     recovery, and it can cancel a running print.
#   gui_service     - vectorp, the touchscreen itself.
# Both the S and CS prefixes are listed because the init script names vary by
# firmware - tools.sh and tools_menu_K1C_2025.sh already probe for both forms.
