# Firmware builds this restore is known-good on. A future Creality firmware could
# ship a different shaper_defs (or react differently to the change), so klippy is
# only modified on listed versions, matched as a substring of the reported firmware
# (check_fw_version, which returns /etc/version on the K1_2025). Space-separated;
# extend as builds are confirmed. Heads-up: .23 was never run on hardware, it is
# listed because its Klipper bytecode is identical to the verified .22. V1.1.0.27
# (the CFS-C build) is bytecode-identical to .26 and has one user execution report.
# Anyone on an unlisted build is asked to report it first rather than have klippy
# touched blindly.
