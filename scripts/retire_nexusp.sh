# The K1C 2025 runs TWO Moonrakers against one Klipper: Creality's forked
# `nexusp` on :7125 (the touchscreen's backend) and the helper script's real one
# on :7126. They share -d /usr/data/printer_data, so one gcode directory and one
# klippy socket, but Creality namespaced the databases.
#
# That split is not merely redundant, it is a trap, and the failure mode is the
# bad kind: querying the wrong port does not fail, it ANSWERS.
#
#   curl -s http://<printer>:7125/server/spoolman/status
#   # nexusp -> {"error": {"code": 404, "message": "Method not found"}}
#
# Read at face value that says Spoolman was never connected on this printer. It
# is wrong, and every user who pastes a :7125 command from a Klipper forum gets
# a plausible-looking wrong answer instead of an error.
#
# This option retires nexusp and puts the real Moonraker on :7125 - the port the
# entire Klipper ecosystem assumes. The touchscreen is never patched: `vectorp`
# hardcodes http://127.0.0.1:7125 and we own what answers there, which is the
# whole trick, because the binary CANNOT be patched - it is a symlink into tmpfs,
# regenerated at boot from an encrypted SCBT blob on p8.
#
# What is load-bearing is not the daemon, it is two JSON-RPC methods the screen
# calls that stock Moonraker does not have. files/moonraker/creality-compat/
# implements them; see the header of creality_compat.py.
#
# THE STEP ORDER IS NOT NEGOTIABLE, AND THE OBVIOUS ORDER IS WRONG
#
#   1  warn about anything that can restart Moonraker behind our back
#   2  stop Moonraker            -- both must be down before step 4
#   3  stop nexusp               --
#   4  merge the print history      (dry run, then --apply; backs up first)
#   5  install the compat component + uncomment [creality_compat]
#   6  rename CS56nexusp_service -> disabled.CS56nexusp_service  <- VERIFY
#   7  moonraker.conf: port 7126 -> 7125
#   8  nginx.conf: server 127.0.0.1:7126; -> :7125;
#   9  start Moonraker, reload nginx explicitly
#  10  verify :7125 answers
#
# "Merge the history first, before anything is disabled" is the obvious order
# and it is impossible: merge_job_history.py refuses to run while any Moonraker
# or nexusp process is alive, because Moonraker caches job_totals in memory and
# writes its stale copy back at the next print.
#
# Step 6 must be VERIFIED before step 7 runs. If the rename fails and the port
# has already moved, nexusp and the real Moonraker both want :7125 and the loser
# dies silently. This uses the same guarded-mv-with-rollback idiom as
# creality_disable_one_service in disable_creality_services.sh, but deliberately
# does NOT call that function: CREALITY_SERVICES_NEVER_DISABLE lists both
# S56nexusp_service and CS56nexusp_service, so it would refuse - correctly, since
# that option does not own nexusp and this one does.
#
# TWO TRAPS WORTH STATING HERE RATHER THAN LEARNING TWICE
#
# - Any Moonraker SUPERVISOR must be stopped first, not just the daemon. The
#   merge checks for a live daemon at one instant; a supervisor can restart
#   Moonraker in the gap and the restarted daemon flushes its cached job_totals
#   over the merged ones. This repo ships no watchdog, so upstream this is a
#   warning rather than a step - a fork that adds one owns disarming it.
# - nginx reload. files/services/S50nginx runs "$NGINX" -s reload with no -c on
#   its reload path, so nginx opens /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, which does not exist
#   on this board, fails, and leaves the OLD config live while reporting
#   nothing. That file is fixed in the same change as this one, but on boxes
#   where Creality's own S50nginx won the `[ ! -f ]` guard at install time the
#   shipped fix is not the file that runs - so reload explicitly here instead of
#   trusting the init verb.
