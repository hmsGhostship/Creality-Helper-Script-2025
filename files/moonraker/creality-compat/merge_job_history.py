#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
# ----------------
# The 2025 runs two Moonrakers against one Klipper: Creality's `nexusp` (the
# touchscreen's backend, :7125) and the helper script's real one (:7126). They
# share `-d /usr/data/printer_data` — one gcode directory, one klippy socket —
# but Creality namespaced the databases, so each keeps its OWN print history:
#
#     printer_data/database/nexusp-sql.db      <- what the touchscreen shows
#     printer_data/database/moonraker-sql.db   <- what Fluidd shows
#
# Every print since the helper stack was installed is therefore written down
# twice, and everything BEFORE that install exists only in nexusp's copy. When
# real Moonraker takes over :7125 and nexusp is retired, the screen starts
# reading Fluidd's database — so without this the printer's history silently
# begins on the day the helper was installed. On the reference unit that was
# 22 of 42 rows that exist nowhere else, including two prints the helper's
# Moonraker had missed entirely.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS, AND WHY RESTORE NEEDS ONE TOO
# ----------------------------------------------
# `--direction to-moonraker` (the default) is retirement: nexusp's rows into
# Moonraker's database. `--direction to-nexusp` is the restore, and it is not
# optional. While nexusp is retired the touchscreen reads and WRITES
# moonraker-sql.db; handing it back a nexusp-sql.db frozen at the retirement
# date would make every print made in between vanish from the screen, with no
# warning and no reason for the user to connect the two events. Same dedupe,
# same backup, same second-run no-op — only the two paths swap.
#
# This is NOT a sync tool. It is one-shot per direction, for the swap window.
# Running it twice is harmless (the dedupe catches everything it already
# inserted), but it has no business existing as a cron job.
#
# THE DEDUPE, AND WHY IT IS FUZZY
# -------------------------------
# Both daemons watch the same klippy, so a print recorded by both produces two
# rows describing one physical job. They are NOT byte-identical: each daemon
# stamps its own `start_time` when it notices the state change, and on the
# reference unit those land ~0.2-1.1 s apart. So the match key is (filename,
# start_time within TOLERANCE_S) rather than equality.
#
# 120 s is deliberately far wider than the observed skew. The input that could
# defeat it is not two unrelated prints — it is a failed print and its immediate
# retry, same filename, minutes apart. Measured on the reference unit, the
# closest such pair is over 600 s apart, so the window keeps 5x margin against
# its own worst realistic case.
#
# JOB_TOTALS ARE NOT ADDITIVE
# ---------------------------
# `job_totals` holds lifetime counters, and the two rowsets OVERLAP, so summing
# them would double-count every shared print. It is also not a simple function of
# job_history: nexusp reports total_jobs=184 while holding 42 rows, because the
# counter survives rows that were pruned. So the merge takes max() PER COLUMN —
# `total` and `maximum` describe different things (a lifetime sum and a single
# job's record), and the row holding the larger sum is not guaranteed to hold the
# larger record. Nothing is invented; each column wins on its own merits. Expect
# Fluidd's "total jobs" to jump from double digits to the machine's real lifetime
# figure. That is the correct number; it only looks wrong because Fluidd has been
# reporting a post-install subset all along.
#
# SAFETY
# ------
# - Dry run by default. `--apply` is required to write anything.
# - Refuses to run while a Moonraker or nexusp process is alive: Moonraker caches
#   `job_totals` in memory and flushes its stale copy back at the next print,
#   straight over the merge.
# - That check is POINT IN TIME. Anything that can restart Moonraker behind your
#   back — a supervisor, a watchdog, a cron entry — must be stopped first, not
#   just the daemon, or it can start one in the gap between the check passing and
#   the write landing. This repo ships no such watchdog, so upstream this is a
#   warning rather than a step; a fork that adds one owns disarming it.
# - Backs the target up next to itself before the first write, and prints the
#   command that restores it. That file is the entire rollback story.
# - RENUMBERS job_id into start_time order, in the same transaction as the
#   inserts. An earlier version deliberately did not, on the stated grounds that
#   "nothing joins on job_id and every surface sorts by start_time". The second
#   half of that is false, and checkably so — Moonraker's own history list is:
#
#       sql_statement += f" ORDER BY job_id {order}"    # history.py, order="desc"
#
#   with no ORDER BY start_time anywhere in the file. Appended rows take the
#   highest ids, so without renumbering the recovered prints — the OLDEST on the
#   machine, which is the entire point of this merge — come back as the most
#   recent jobs in Fluidd and on the touchscreen, while server.history.count
#   reports the right total. A correct scrollbar over a wrongly ordered list is
#   exactly the plausible-wrong-answer failure retiring nexusp exists to remove.
#
#   What renumbering costs is the identity of rows a client may already hold: a
#   Fluidd tab left open across the merge could delete by an id that now names a
#   different print. That needs a tab open across a daemon restart AND a delete
#   issued into the seconds before the port moves and Moonraker comes back. The
#   mis-ordering it prevents is permanent and visible to everyone.
