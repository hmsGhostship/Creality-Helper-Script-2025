# creality_compat.py — the two JSON-RPC methods Creality's touchscreen needs and
# upstream Moonraker does not have. A Moonraker component; runs on the K1C 2025
# only, at components/creality_compat.py, enabled by `[creality_compat]` in
# moonraker.conf.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The 2025 ships two Moonrakers against one Klipper: Creality's `nexusp` on
# :7125 for the touchscreen, and the helper script's real one on :7126 for
# everything else. That split is an active trap — a query to the "wrong" port
# ANSWERS, plausibly and incorrectly — so the "Retire Nexusp Backend" option
# switches nexusp off and moves real Moonraker onto :7125. The screen
# (`vectorp`) reconnects on its own and works, with two exceptions, both of
# which are calls to methods only Creality's fork had:
#
#     server.files.get_directory_ex   the file browser's paging/sort/search
#     server.history.count            called once the moment the screen connects
#
# Without them the browser renders its first page (from stock `server.files.list`)
# and then cannot scroll, filter or search. This file closes that gap. It is a
# COMPATIBILITY SHIM, not a feature: every behaviour below was measured against
# a real nexusp before it was switched off, on one K1C 2025 running
# V1.0.0.22.20250711S. The measurements cannot be re-derived once a user has
# retired nexusp, so test_creality_compat.py beside this file is their only
# executable record.
#
# THE RULES, ALL MEASURED, NONE GUESSED
# -------------------------------------
# `path`, `start`, `limit` and `order` are ALL required. nexusp rejects a call
# missing `path` with "No data for argument: path" and one missing any of the
# other three with a bare "Invalid parameter" that names nothing — which is why
# the parameter names had to come out of the binary's strings in the first place.
# Being more lenient than the reference was considered and rejected: the only
# client is closed-source, so the safe shim is the one that cannot behave
# differently from what that client has always been handed.
#
# What is listed, in a directory:
#   - subdirectories, ALWAYS, and always sorted ahead of every file
#   - files whose name ends in `.gcode` — measured: an empty `.gcode` IS listed
#     (so this is an extension test, not a has-metadata test), while `.gco`,
#     `.txt` and anything else are NOT, even though Moonraker's own listing
#     accepts `.g` and `.gco` as gcode
#   - nothing whose name starts with `.` — which is why `gcodes/.thumbs` never
#     appears on the screen even though Fluidd shows it
#
# `order` is a comma-separated triple as the screen sends it —
# `name,asc,folder`, `datetime,desc,folder`, `size,asc,folder` — where the third
# token is always `folder` and nothing is keyed off it. Known fields are
# name/filename, datetime (mtime) and size. ANY unrecognised value — including
# "files", "type" and outright nonsense — falls back to name ascending rather
# than erroring, which is nexusp's behaviour and not an accident of this port.
#
# Name ordering is a NATURAL sort here: digit runs compare numerically and text
# compares case-insensitively. nexusp did a plain codepoint sort, which put every
# capitalised name ahead of every lowercase one and ordered `ss_ruin_2`,
# `ss_ruin_10`, `ss_ruin_3` in that order. This is the one deliberate improvement
# on the reference in this file.
#
# `keyword` is a case-insensitive substring match on the name, and it narrows
# `count` as well as the page. It applies to FILES ONLY — subdirectories are
# listed whatever the keyword, per the rule above.
#
# That last part is the one behaviour in this file chosen rather than measured.
# The ten golden captures happen not to cover it: the only keyword case has no
# subdirectories in it and the only directory case sends no keyword, so what
# nexusp did here is genuinely unknown. Of the two readings, this is the one
# that cannot make something vanish from the browser — a folder disappearing
# while you type is indistinguishable from a folder that was deleted.
#
# `since` and `before` are accepted and DELIBERATELY IGNORED, because that is
# what nexusp does. Measured, not assumed: a window excluding almost every file
# left `count` unchanged at 92. Implementing them properly would hide files the
# screen has always been shown, which is a worse failure than the one being
# fixed — a file that vanishes from the browser looks like a file that was
# deleted.
#
# `count` is the total AFTER keyword filtering and BEFORE paging, so the screen
# can size its scrollbar. `start` past the end returns an empty page with the
# count intact, and `limit: 0` returns an empty page — also measured.
#
# THUMBNAILS ARE READ OFF THE DISK, NOT OUT OF THE METADATA
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# The first version of this shim passed Moonraker's `thumbnails` through
# untouched, and 66 of 91 files came back thumbnail-less on the screen. The cause
# is not the shim and not the screen: Moonraker lists only the thumbnails the
# SLICER embedded in the gcode, while `nexusp` also rendered its own into
# `.thumbs` and listed those too. Measured — every file has 48/96/195/300 on
# disk, Moonraker lists 48 and 195 for NONE of them, and the 66 files whose
# slicer emitted 100/320 instead of 96/300 have no listed size the screen will
# take. Those 66 are exactly the ones that went blank.
#
# So each file's `thumbnails` is the union of Moonraker's parsed entries and
# every `<stem>-<W>x<H>.png` actually present in `.thumbs`. Reporting what exists
# rather than what was parsed is what makes this safe without knowing the
# screen's size-selection rule.
#
# It also GENERATES the two sizes nexusp used to render and Moonraker never
# does — 48x48 and 195x195 — for any file that lacks them, downscaling from the
# largest thumbnail present, once per file, and never by UPSCALING: a 32x32 blown
# up to a 195x195 tile is a blurred mess that reads as a broken thumbnail rather
# than an absent one. Set `generate_thumbnails: False` in `[creality_compat]` to
# turn it off and go back to listing only what exists.
#
# PILLOW IS NOT IN THE MOONRAKER VENV THIS REPO SHIPS
# ---------------------------------------------------
# Upstream Moonraker lists Pillow in requirements.txt, and it is NOT in
# `files/moonraker/moonraker.tar.gz` — the venv the helper actually installs is
# Python 3.8 with apprise, jinja2, ldap3, dbus_fast, inotify_simple and no PIL,
# and `install_moonraker_nginx` only ever runs `git pull` on the source repo.
# So on a clean helper box:
#
#   - generation here is off, and says so once in the log rather than throwing
#     a traceback per file;
#   - Moonraker's OWN metadata.py imports PIL at module scope, so it parses no
#     embedded thumbnails either — a freshly uploaded gcode has nothing on disk
#     AND nothing parsed, and there is no source image to downscale from. The
#     screen shows no thumbnail for it at all.
#
# Installing Pillow into moonraker-env fixes both — the second one for every
# helper user, retired nexusp or not. "Retire Nexusp Backend" offers to do it.
# A directory listing must never fail because an optional renderer is absent,
# so everything above degrades to "list what is on disk" and nothing else.
#
# WHAT IS NOT SHIMMED
# -------------------
# The gap analysis found four Creality-only methods. The other two stay missing
# on purpose: `server.history.debug.job` returns `{"last_row_id": N}` and is
# internal, and `server.debug.status` dumps nexusp's socket buffers and emits
# MALFORMED JSON (a trailing comma) that strict parsers reject. Neither is
# screen-facing; each was logged exactly once, at connect, with nothing visibly
# broken afterwards.
#
# `printer.info` and `printer.objects.list` are deliberately NOT registered here
# either, even though they answer `-32601 Method not found` for about four
# seconds after a cold boot while the screen polls. They are genuine Moonraker
# methods registered dynamically when klippy connects, and `register_endpoint`
# returns early for an already-registered path when the incoming registration is
# remote — klippy's are remote. A static registration would therefore not
# collide with klippy's later one, it would silently WIN it for the life of the
# process, and a stub answering `printer.info` forever is far worse than a
# four-second gap at boot.
#
# COUPLING, HONESTLY — THREE, NOT TWO
# -----------------------------------
# 1. `file_manager._list_directory` (private)
# 2. `file_manager._convert_request_path` (private)
# 3. raw SQL against `history.history_table`, Moonraker's own SQL table wrapper
#
# 1 and 2 are private because reimplementing metadata lookup and root resolution
# would be a second source of truth for the thing most likely to drift. Both are
# checked at COMPONENT LOAD, not at request time, and a missing one raises with
# the attribute's name: `install_moonraker_nginx` runs `git checkout master; git
# pull`, so every user's Moonraker is a moving target against a frozen venv, and
# the offline tests below use fakes and can never catch a rename. Failing at
# startup with the missing name is the only warning anyone gets.
#
# The table name for 3 is imported from Moonraker's own history component rather
# than repeated here, so a rename there is an ImportError at load for the same
# reason.

        A file with nothing on disk and nothing parsed gets nothing: there is no
        source image, and inventing one is not on the table. On a box without
        Pillow that is every freshly uploaded file, because Moonraker's metadata
        parser needs Pillow too — see the header.

        LANCZOS resizes plus flash writes for a whole page would otherwise block
        the loop that also serves klippy and Fluidd, during a print.
